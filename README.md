# AI commits

Generates ChatGPT commit messages.

Based on [AI GIT commits](https://github.com/tskoyo/ai-git-commit).

**BE AWARE: the attempt is to generate the best commit messages regardless of cost. Check the [usage dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/usage) to avoid unexpected charges.**

## Example

![Example output](https://github.com/nielskrijger/ai-commits/blob/main/example.png?raw=true)

## Usage

Git clone this repository and run the following command:

```bash
$ go run . --debug --dir <path-to-git-repo> --hint "<hint>"
```

The "hint" is optional and can be used to guide the AI in the direction of the commit message. Simply add a few words about what you want the commit message to focus on.

For more options, run:

```bash
$ go run . --help
```

In practice, you should only use one of the subject lines generated by the AI and ignore most of the text. Because the confidence indicator is quite bad make sure to check out suggestions as well.
